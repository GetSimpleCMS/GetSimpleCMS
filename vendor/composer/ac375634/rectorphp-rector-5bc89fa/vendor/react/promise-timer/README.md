## Usage

This lightweight library consists only of a few simple functions.
All functions reside under the `React\Promise\Timer` namespace.

The below examples refer to all functions with their fully-qualified names like this:

```php
React\Promise\Timer\timeout(…);
```

As of PHP 5.6+ you can also import each required function into your code like this:

```php
use function React\Promise\Timer\timeout;

timeout(…);
```

Alternatively, you can also use an import statement similar to this:

```php
use React\Promise\Timer;

Timer\timeout(…);
```

### timeout()

The `timeout(PromiseInterface<mixed, Throwable|mixed> $promise, float $time, ?LoopInterface $loop = null): PromiseInterface<mixed, TimeoutException|Throwable|mixed>` function can be used to
cancel operations that take *too long*.

You need to pass in an input `$promise` that represents a pending operation
and timeout parameters. It returns a new promise with the following
resolution behavior:

- If the input `$promise` resolves before `$time` seconds, resolve the
  resulting promise with its fulfillment value.

- If the input `$promise` rejects before `$time` seconds, reject the
  resulting promise with its rejection value.

- If the input `$promise` does not settle before `$time` seconds, *cancel*
  the operation and reject the resulting promise with a [`TimeoutException`](#timeoutexception).

Internally, the given `$time` value will be used to start a timer that will
*cancel* the pending operation once it triggers. This implies that if you
pass a really small (or negative) value, it will still start a timer and will
thus trigger at the earliest possible time in the future.

If the input `$promise` is already settled, then the resulting promise will
resolve or reject immediately without starting a timer at all.

This function takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
pass the event loop instance to use. You can use a `null` value here in order to
use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop). This value
SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a given event
loop instance.

A common use case for handling only resolved values looks like this:

```php
$promise = accessSomeRemoteResource();
React\Promise\Timer\timeout($promise, 10.0)->then(function ($value) {
    // the operation finished within 10.0 seconds
});
```

A more complete example could look like this:

```php
$promise = accessSomeRemoteResource();
React\Promise\Timer\timeout($promise, 10.0)->then(
    function ($value) {
        // the operation finished within 10.0 seconds
    },
    function ($error) {
        if ($error instanceof React\Promise\Timer\TimeoutException) {
            // the operation has failed due to a timeout
        } else {
            // the input operation has failed due to some other error
        }
    }
);
```

Or if you're using [react/promise v3](https://github.com/reactphp/promise):

```php
React\Promise\Timer\timeout($promise, 10.0)->then(function ($value) {
    // the operation finished within 10.0 seconds
})->catch(function (React\Promise\Timer\TimeoutException $error) {
    // the operation has failed due to a timeout
})->catch(function (Throwable $error) {
    // the input operation has failed due to some other error
});
```

As discussed above, the [`timeout()`](#timeout) function will take care of
the underlying operation if it takes *too long*. In this case, you can be
sure the resulting promise will always be rejected with a
[`TimeoutException`](#timeoutexception). On top of this, the function will
try to *cancel* the underlying operation. Responsibility for this
cancellation logic is left up to the underlying operation.

- A common use case involves cleaning up any resources like open network
  sockets or file handles or terminating external processes or timers.

- If the given input `$promise` does not support cancellation, then this is a
  NO-OP. This means that while the resulting promise will still be rejected,
  the underlying input `$promise` may still be pending and can hence continue
  consuming resources

On top of this, the returned promise is implemented in such a way that it can
be cancelled when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will
cancel the underlying operation. As discussed above, responsibility for this
cancellation logic is left up to the underlying operation.

```php
$promise = accessSomeRemoteResource();
$timeout = React\Promise\Timer\timeout($promise, 10.0);

$timeout->cancel();
```

For more details on the promise cancellation, please refer to the
[Promise documentation](https://github.com/reactphp/promise#cancellablepromiseinterface).

If you want to wait for multiple promises to resolve, you can use the normal
promise primitives like this:

```php
$promises = array(
    accessSomeRemoteResource(),
    accessSomeRemoteResource(),
    accessSomeRemoteResource()
);

$promise = React\Promise\all($promises);

React\Promise\Timer\timeout($promise, 10)->then(function ($values) {
    // *all* promises resolved
});
```

The applies to all promise collection primitives alike, i.e. `all()`,
`race()`, `any()`, `some()` etc.

For more details on the promise primitives, please refer to the
[Promise documentation](https://github.com/reactphp/promise#functions).

### sleep()

The `sleep(float $time, ?LoopInterface $loop = null): PromiseInterface<void, RuntimeException>` function can be used to
create a new promise that resolves in `$time` seconds.

```php
React\Promise\Timer\sleep(1.5)->then(function () {
    echo 'Thanks for waiting!' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

Internally, the given `$time` value will be used to start a timer that will
resolve the promise once it triggers. This implies that if you pass a really
small (or negative) value, it will still start a timer and will thus trigger
at the earliest possible time in the future.

This function takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
pass the event loop instance to use. You can use a `null` value here in order to
use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop). This value
SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a given event
loop instance.

The returned promise is implemented in such a way that it can be cancelled
when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will reject its value
with a `RuntimeException` and clean up any pending timers.

```php
$timer = React\Promise\Timer\sleep(2.0);

$timer->cancel();
```

### ~~resolve()~~

> Deprecated since v1.8.0, see [`sleep()`](#sleep) instead.

The `resolve(float $time, ?LoopInterface $loop = null): PromiseInterface<float, RuntimeException>` function can be used to
create a new promise that resolves in `$time` seconds with the `$time` as the fulfillment value.

```php
React\Promise\Timer\resolve(1.5)->then(function ($time) {
    echo 'Thanks for waiting ' . $time . ' seconds' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

Internally, the given `$time` value will be used to start a timer that will
resolve the promise once it triggers. This implies that if you pass a really
small (or negative) value, it will still start a timer and will thus trigger
at the earliest possible time in the future.

This function takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
pass the event loop instance to use. You can use a `null` value here in order to
use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop). This value
SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a given event
loop instance.

The returned promise is implemented in such a way that it can be cancelled
when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will reject its value
with a `RuntimeException` and clean up any pending timers.

```php
$timer = React\Promise\Timer\resolve(2.0);

$timer->cancel();
```

### ~~reject()~~

> Deprecated since v1.8.0, see [`sleep()`](#sleep) instead.

The `reject(float $time, ?LoopInterface $loop = null): PromiseInterface<void, TimeoutException|RuntimeException>` function can be used to
create a new promise which rejects in `$time` seconds with a `TimeoutException`.

```php
React\Promise\Timer\reject(2.0)->then(null, function (React\Promise\Timer\TimeoutException $e) {
    echo 'Rejected after ' . $e->getTimeout() . ' seconds ' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

Internally, the given `$time` value will be used to start a timer that will
reject the promise once it triggers. This implies that if you pass a really
small (or negative) value, it will still start a timer and will thus trigger
at the earliest possible time in the future.

This function takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
pass the event loop instance to use. You can use a `null` value here in order to
use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop). This value
SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a given event
loop instance.

The returned promise is implemented in such a way that it can be cancelled
when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will reject its value
with a `RuntimeException` and clean up any pending timers.

```php
$timer = React\Promise\Timer\reject(2.0);

$timer->cancel();
```

### TimeoutException

The `TimeoutException` extends PHP's built-in `RuntimeException`.


#### getTimeout()

The `getTimeout(): float` method can be used to
get the timeout value in seconds.
