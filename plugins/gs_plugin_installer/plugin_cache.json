It is true by default. Setting it to false will cause the function to return the menu HTML as a string instead of outputting it directly.\r\n* Added an event trigger to clear the cache after a page is deleted.\r\n* Added a check to make sure that a parent page is set to be displayed in the nav before adding any children to it. This should also prevent pages nested deeper than 1 level from mucking up the array.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/nested-menus\/256\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/2085\/256\/nested-menus.zip","downloads":"5137","rating":4.2},{"status":"successful","id":"264","filename_id":"cbcontact_form.php","name":"Contact Form","version":"6","category":"Plugin","tags":"contact form, captcha, email, message, smtp, phpmailer","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"April 6, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forum\/topic\/946\/plugin-contact-form-getsimple\/","author_url":"http:\/\/www.cumbe.es\/contact\/","owner":"cumbe","description":"Add a contact form to web site.  \r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n*    captcha system with reload.\r\n*    works with  &#039;Fancy urls&#039; enabled, too.\r\n*    send email with contact details to one or severals users of admin or emails.  \r\n*    The log is save in data\/other\/logs\/cbcontactform.log  \r\n*    In admin &gt; pages &gt; View contact form logs button.  \r\nIf contacform.log is not, then message: Missing file: &lsquo;contactform.log&rsquo;.  \r\n*    From v5.4.1: is possible remove the logs from admin &gt; plugins &gt; View contact form logs button.  \r\n*    From v5.5: is possible send message from class phpmailer.

(thanks shawn_a)\r\n\r\nHOOKS\r\n----\r\n\r\n* `edit-above-content` = Called above the WYSIWYG editor, and below the Page title box.\r\n\r\n* `register-data` = Registers data to the plugin under the variable given. More information below. Required for some functions.\r\n\r\n* `development-settings` = Called in the development section of the settings page.\r\n\r\n* `dev-####` = Placing &quot;dev-&quot; ahead of any existing tab or sidebar hook hides it while development mode is inactive.\r\n\r\nFILTERS\r\n----\r\n\r\n* `###-exec` = When a user types into the content :[&quot;someitem&quot;]: the filter &quot;someitem-exec&quot; will be fired.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_print( ARRAY )` = Prints out an array within a &lt;pre&gt; tag. Pretty!\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_array( ARRAY, SEARCH )` = Searches a multidimensional array for a key-name specified in SEARCH. \r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_page( SEARCH ) `= Attempts to find SEARCH in all xml pages, returning the pages and locations if found.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_load( SEARCH )` = Loads all items with the key-name SEARCH from data registered to the calling plugin.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_form(DATA, TITLE, ARRAY)` = Creates a simple form. More information below.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_template( FILE, FOLDER )` = Searches the template for tokens. Returning function calls. More below.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_token()` = For use with `Toolkit_template`.\r\n\r\nTEMPLATE FUNCTION SEARCH\r\n----\r\n\r\nBy default, a template search automatically happens when loading up the edit.php file. It will search the currently active template and populate the global variable `$FUNCTION_CALLS` with an array of content function calls and their parameters.\r\n\r\nYou can invoke the search manually with the function `Toolkit_template( FILE, FOLDER )`. Which will then return the array.\r\n\r\nThe search looks for the function `Toolkit_token()`. All functions that connect to the &quot;content&quot; filter will automatically have tokens applied. Call the token within your plugins function if you want it to be visible in the search.\r\n\r\nREGISTER DATA\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can register data for your plugins use which small plugin toolkit will handle loading and saving.\r\n\r\nTo do so, add an action same as any other.\r\n\r\n    add_action(&quot;register-data&quot;,&quot;mydata&quot;);\r\n\r\nHowever unlike a regular action, the function call is not a function but a variable. Make sure it is unique as a global variable (&quot;mydata&quot;) will be created and populated with your information.\r\n\r\nThe data will be saved automatically near script close. Data is stored as JSON so standard JSON limitations apply to what can be saved.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE FORM\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can create a simple form with this plugin. However first ensure you have registered data.\r\n\r\nLets break it down:\r\n\r\n    Toolkit_form( DATA, TITLE, ARRAY );\r\n\r\n`DATA` refers to your registered data. The form will use this to save its information, under the array key of &quot;FORM&quot;.\r\n\r\n`TITLE` is a string that will appear above your form in h3 format. This is not necessary and you can put nothing in the slot.\r\n\r\n`ARRAY` is an array of values that will make up the forms inputs. The values are as follows:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n* `type` = REQUIRED. Options are &quot;checkbox&quot; &quot;text&quot; &quot;dropdown&quot; &quot;textarea&quot; &quot;hidden&quot;.\r\n\r\n* `name` = REQUIRED. The name of the form element. Will also be the name of the corresponding key in data.\r\n\r\n* `value` = Sets a value for the form element. Also acts as default content. Dropdown types require this to be an array. Each item represents a choice in this case.\r\n\r\n* `label` = String that will be displayed as the form element&#039;s label.\r\n\r\n* `class` = Makes the element of this class.\r\n\r\n* `override` = Currently unused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThe function will take care of the save button and the data storage.\r\n An example usage:\r\n\r\n    $form = array(\r\n    array(&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;checkbox&quot;,&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;mycheck&quot;,&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Click me for a good time!&quot;),\r\n    array(&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;mytext&quot;,&quot;value&quot;=&gt;&quot;Write in me!&quot;));\r\n\r\n    Toolkit_form(&quot;mydata&quot;,&quot;This is my form!&quot;,$form);","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/small-plugin-toolkit\/531\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/5501\/531\/small-plugin-toolkit.zip","downloads":"2527","rating":4.7},{"status":"successful","id":"768","filename_id":"SpecialPagesExtras.php","name":"I18N Special Pages extras","version":"1.20","category":"Plugin","tags":"field required,field validation,special pages,field info,required,I18N Special Pages,images","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"June 20, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=5653","author_url":"http:\/\/flexphperia.net","owner":"mganko","description":"This plugin allows you to control which special page fields are required, validate fields by regex, it allows you to add additional info text next to field label, add special field types and set some page options like: title label, content label, hide keywords and meta descriptions fields etc\r\n\r\nIt requires I18N Special Pages plugin installed (tested with 1.2.1 version and above).\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Translations:&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;English&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Polish&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Version history:&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.20 - bug fix (some servers could not save settings)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.19 - new option: now you can define field size in px or %, some bug fixes&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.18 - new option: hide menu field&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.17 - new options: show page type title, auto open page options, hide content field&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.16 - title field regular expression validation&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.15 - new special field type **Multi select list**&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.14 - new special field type **Image with thumb** that allows validating selected image by its size , aspect ratio&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.13 - new option to turn on better image browser for image fields, in page configuration.

It allows your users to view and annotate over 50 common document and image types on your website without the need to install any office software or browser plugins. To name a few, supported file formats include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, CAD and raster images (TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP).\r\n\r\nGroupDocs.Annotation for Java is a downloadable library designed as a middleware to let developers seamlessly integrate it into their Java apps or websites. The library converts documents to web-compatible content (HTML\/CSS\/images) on the server and then renders it in users&rsquo; web-browsers like a regular web-page. This client-server (or &ldquo;thin client&rdquo;) architecture provides you with the following benefits:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Cross-platform compatibility.&lt;\/b&gt; Since documents are rendered similar to regular web-pages, they can be viewed and annotated from any web-enabled device with a web-browser. There is no need to install any office software or browser plugins on end users&rsquo; machines. Supported browsers include: Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari 5+ and their mobile versions.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Advanced document security.&lt;\/b&gt; Source documents are not downloaded to users&rsquo; machines during annotation sessions and can be rendered in a &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; mode. The library allows you to restrict or disable print, download and text copy options for specific documents to prevent users from unauthorized copying of the documents shared on your website. You can also display watermarks over the shared documents to protect them from screen-grabbing.\r\n\r\nGroupDocs.Annotation for Java comes with a convenient GUI that can be embedded to any web-page along with documents. It allows end users to easily navigate and annotate large multi-page documents in a web-browser. Other benefits include:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;A comprehensive set of annotation tools:&lt;\/b&gt; sticky notes, text underline\/strikethrough, polyline, rectangle, arrow, redaction, ruler, watermarks, etc.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Multi-user annotation sessions.&lt;\/b&gt; The library allows several users to annotate the same document on your website simultaneously. Users can see each other&rsquo;s annotations, add comments and reply to them in real time.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Support for native Microsoft Word and PDF annotations.&lt;\/b&gt; PDF or Microsoft Word documents annotated online on your website can then be saved along with the added annotations in them for further offline editing. Likewise, PDF and Word documents annotated offline can be imported to GroupDocs.Annotation for online review.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocsannotation-for-java\/942\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/6355\/942\/groupdocs.annotation-for-java.zip","downloads":"15","rating":0},{"status":"successful","id":"737","filename_id":"news_manager_createpost.php","name":"News Manager CreatePost","version":"0.2","category":"Plugin","tags":"news manager, shortcut, admin, create post","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.2","updated_date":"November 23, 2013","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=3972","author_url":"http:\/\/www.cyberiada.org\/cnb\/","owner":"Carlos","description":"This simple plugin shows a shortcut link in GS Page Management sidebar for quickly creating News Manager posts.\r\n\r\nRequires News Manager plugin.\r\n\r\nIt should work with 2.2.4 and newer updated versions (&lt;http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/news-manager-updated\/541\/&gt;)\r\n\r\nGitHub repo: &lt;https:\/\/github.com\/cnb\/News_Manager_CreatePost-getsimplecms&gt;","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/news-manager-createpost\/737\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/311\/737\/news-manager-createpost.zip","downloads":"273","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"739","filename_id":"image-alignment-classes.php","name":"Image Alignment Classes","version":"1.0","category":"Plugin","tags":"images, themes, developers","tested_earliest":"3.2.3","tested_latest":"3.2.3","updated_date":"November 26, 2013","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=5399","author_url":"http:\/\/richjenks.com","owner":"rjenkins1984","description":"# Image Alignment Classes v1.0\r\nby [richjenks.com](http:\/\/richjenks.com)\r\n\r\nCKEditor (the WYSIWYG content editor used by GetSimple) adds inline styles to aligned images in the form of the `float` CSS property.

It creates an iframe on the web-page where it is used and simply transfers all user inputs to the GroupDocs Cloud API.\r\n\r\nUnlike the cloud-based version, this plugin integrates the downloadable GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library (DLL) into the GetnSimple CMS and allows you to display documents without any cloud API calls, redirections, iframes, etc. The library is designed to be easy to integrate into any ASP.NET app or website. Complemented by this plugin, it is now even easier to deploy GroupDocs.Viewer into your GetSimple website.\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Key Feature &amp; Benefits&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n1. &lt;b&gt;Native text rendering.&lt;\/b&gt; GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library provides two document rendering modes. The first, rasterizes documents to images. Text, however, is extracted and rendered in a separate layer on top of rasterized backgrounds in this mode. The second, converts documents to pure HTML, CSS and SVG. Whatever mode you choose, documents are rendered as real text files, allowing users to search for, select and copy text right from documents embedded to a web-page. Native text rendering also ensures fonts always look clear and sharp.\r\n\r\n2. &lt;b&gt;Cross-Platform Compatibility.&lt;\/b&gt; Documents rendered with GroupDocs.Viewer can be viewed from any web-enabled device, including mobiles and tablets. Also, there is no need to install 3rd party software or plugins client-side. You just embed documents into a web-page and users can view them right away using any common web-browser.\r\n\r\n3. &lt;b&gt;User Friendly Interface.&lt;\/b&gt; The viewer comes with a convenient UI that can be embedded to web-pages and allows users to easily browse large documents in a web-browser. When viewing documents through the interface, users can turn pages like slides, preview them with thumbnails, zoom in\/out of a document, download and print documents right from browser, etc.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocsviewer-for-net-html5-document-viewer\/857\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/6355\/857\/groupdocs.viewer-for-.net-html5-document-viewer.zip","downloads":"139","rating":0},{"status":"successful","id":"858","filename_id":"ExtraGallery.php","name":"Extra Gallery","version":"1.04","category":"Plugin","tags":"gallery,multi language,cropping,thumbnail,images,galleries,extra","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"July 22, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=6761","author_url":"http:\/\/flexphperia.net\/","owner":"mganko","description":"Extra Gallery is a backend plugin for creating galleries, with advanced features like: custom fields, thumbnails cropping, multi language content, easy image browsing.

Linking to these anchors can be done with the ckeditors link-button in submenu anchor of this site. The plugins animation works from top to bottom as well as bottom to top.\r\n\r\nIf your editor has no anchor button, you can set anchors manually. A anchor is defined by an empty link with ID. The definded anchors can be selected by klicking on the add link button and choose link to anchor in the text.\r\n\r\nExample : &amp;lt;a id=&quot;heading1&quot; name=&quot;heading1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nCurrent version : 1.0.5\r\n\r\n== Changelog ==\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.5\r\n\r\n* Added: More info @ infopage\r\n* Added: Some translations\r\n* Fixed: A bug with the preview button\r\n* Fixed: UI tweaks\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.4\r\n\r\n* Added: Redo function\r\n* Added: Information page\r\n* Added: English language file\r\n* Fixed: Some smaller bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.3\r\n\r\n* Added: jQuery.localScroll 1.3.5\r\n* Added: jQuery.scrollTo 1.4.14\r\n* Added: Color picker function\r\n* Added: Preview background switcher\r\n* Fixed: More bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.2\r\n\r\n* Added: Button opacity option\r\n* Added: Button color option\r\n* Added: Button live preview\r\n* Added: FontAwesome option\r\n* Fixed: Some bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.1\r\n\r\n* Added: Button icon option\r\n* Added: Button CSS option\r\n* Added: Button text option\r\n* Added: Animation types\r\n* Added: Animation delay function\r\n* Added: jQuery Easing v1.3\r\n* Added: German language file\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.0\r\n\r\n* First stable version","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/scroll-me-up\/883\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/19455\/883\/scroll-me-up.zip","downloads":"337","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"891","filename_id":"mod1fy_dlmanager.php","name":"Download Manager by Mod1fy.net","version":"1.0.5","category":"Plugin","tags":"download,files,manager,count,logs,no,hotlinking,stats,shortcodes","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"January 9, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=7011","author_url":"http:\/\/mod1fy.net\/","owner":"dennis_maassen","description":"Download Manager for GetSimple\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLinks :\r\n--------\r\n\r\n[Support forum thread](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=7011 &quot;GetSimple Forum&quot;)\r\n\r\n[Demo](http:\/\/mod1fy.net\/gsplugins\/ &quot;Mod1fy.net&quot;)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter plugin activation :\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter activation of this plugin there will be generated a new template file in your current themes root directory called **&quot;download_manager.php&quot;** .\r\n\r\nGo to **pages tab** and create a **new page**.

It is a multi-format, web-oriented document annotation library that allows users to view, securely share and annotate over 50 document and image types using only a web-browser. Once installed, you will be able to embed documents along with a convenient document view and annotation UI to any page on your website. Key features include:\r\n\r\n1. &lt;b&gt;Support for all common document and image types:&lt;\/b&gt; users can view\/annotate PDF &amp; Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook messages, Project files, Visio diagrams, as well as files in OpenDocument formats, TXT, RTF, CSV, CAD and raster images (TIFF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP).\r\n\r\n2. &lt;b&gt;Platform independent:&lt;\/b&gt; documents embedded to your website using the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library, can be viewed and annotated from any web-enabled device with a regular browser. Your website visitors don&rsquo;t have to install any office software. Supported browsers include: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari5+, IE8+ and their mobile versions.\r\n\r\n3. &lt;b&gt;Collaborative annotation workflows:&lt;\/b&gt; joined annotation sessions allow multiple users to review and annotate the same document at a time. Each can see others&rsquo; comments and reply to them in real time. Annotated documents can be printed out or exported to PDF with annotations in them. Besides, annotations placed online on a Word or PDF document are compatible with native Microsoft Word or PDF annotations respectively. This allows your visitors to save Word\/PDF documents annotated on your website with the added annotations for further offline editing.\r\n\r\n4. &lt;b&gt;Secure document sharing:&lt;\/b&gt; the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library doesn&rsquo;t download original documents to your visitors machines during view\/annotation sessions, which prevents potential security flaws. The library converts documents that you embed to your website to a combination of HTML markup, CSS, images and JS, and then renders these on user web-browsers. The download, print and copy\/paste options available by default in the UI, can be easily disabled. This allows you to prevent unauthorized copying of your content, while still sharing your documents on the website. For enhanced security, you can also add watermarks and redact text\/images in the documents you share.\r\n\r\n5. &lt;b&gt;Keep your documents in-house:&lt;\/b&gt; unlike the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocs-documents-annotation\/578\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cloud-based version&lt;\/a&gt; released earlier, this plugin integrates the downloadable .NET library, which can be deployed on-premises.

This plugin is still in its early versions, I apologize for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\n### Features ###\r\n\r\n* Instant config update from within your GS backend\r\n* Nicely ordered settings per topic with additional help and links\r\n* Tweak all GSconfig settings with just 1 or 2 clicks.\r\n* Generate a custom CKeditor toolbar right from the UI.\r\n* Reset all settings to their defaults.\r\n* Check GSconfig settings easily by using the hook `add_action(&#039;gsconfig-load&#039;, $function)`, which gives you access to `$gsconfig`. To get a config setting simply do `$gsconfig[&#039;CONSTANT&#039;]`. If `null` is returned, the setting is commented out or === default value.\r\n* All default GS Custom Settings features (search, export\/ import)\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\n\r\n1. If you haven&#039;t already, install [GS Custom Settings 0.4+](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/gs-custom-settings\/913\/).\r\n2. [Download the plugin](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/gsconfig-ui\/938\/), extract to plugins folder, activate in plugins tab and navigate to the GS Custom Settings &#039;Site&#039; tab. In the sidebar you will see an item &#039;GSconfig UI&#039;\r\n3. Tweak all the settings you like :)\r\n\r\n### Notes ###\r\n\r\n* This plugin requires [GS Custom Settings 0.4+](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/gs-custom-settings\/913\/)\r\n* If you had config changes before installing, make sure to synchronize them in the UI before hitting &#039;Save updates&#039; the first time\r\n* This plugin directly edits gsconfig.php. It is important that you do not have the same constant (even when commented out) twice or more in the file.\r\n* The setting  `GSEDITOROPTIONS` need some polishing.\r\n\r\n### Preview ###\r\n\r\n![](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/czkUu5o.png)GSconfig UI is a UI shim of `gsconfig.php`.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/gsconfig-ui\/938\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/10656\/938\/gsconfig-ui.zip","downloads":"262","rating":0},{"status":"successful","id":"946","filename_id":"adminxml_plus.php","name":"AdminXML Plus","version":"0.2","category":"Plugin","tags":"admin, theme, xml, settings","tested_earliest":"3.2.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"June 2, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=7325","author_url":"http:\/\/webketje.com","owner":"Tyblitz","description":"AdminXML Plus allows easily &amp; quickly customizing the admin.xml file from the GS interface, with instant preview, thereby making it easy to see which color scheme fits your install best.
